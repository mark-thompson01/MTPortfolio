      <h2>AI vs. Humanity: The Modern Job Market’s Ethical Drift</h2>

      <p>As we approach the end of 2025 and move into 2026, I want to shed some light on the impacts many have witnessed or experienced directly across the job market with the rise of AI in modern society.</p>

      <p>To be clear, AI alone isn’t the single factor behind the job market we’re seeing in 2025. And the job market is not the same across every corner of the globe, as AI adoption in hiring varies significantly between countries, industries, and economic conditions.</p>

      <p>I do believe however that the power of AI has significantly shaped what many are experiencing and how it feels, especially in the hiring process.</p>

      <p>Personally, I don’t believe AI is the real problem. I believe the problem lies in how AI is being used, and that the issue is rooted more in human behavior than in the technology itself. AI is meant to be a resourceful tool, not a moral scapegoat.</p>

      <p>Many workers feel as though organizations see them as data points due to the increased use of AI, automated tracking, and data-driven decision systems.</p><br><br>

   

      <h2>Where AI Was Supposed to Help – and Where It Went Wrong</h2>

      <p>People and organizations use AI for efficiency as entities. And when it comes to hiring, I think it’s fair to say efficiency is the main intention behind using it. AI in the job market was intended to make hiring more fair and efficient. We have this advanced technology capable of reshaping how we live and work. But in many organizations, technology is being used in ways that can and often do make people feel disposable.</p>

      <p>A growing number of companies now use AI tools to filter applicants before a human ever reviews a resume. These systems allow every submission to be processed, something recruiters simply can't do manually, but they also scan for keywords, match patterns, and automatically reject candidates who don't align with preset criteria. Not every company uses these systems, but enough do that they've reshaped the applicant experience, often making the process feel impersonal even if the intention behind them is efficiency.</p>
 
      <p>To be fair, this reshaped experience isn’t caused by AI alone. The sheer volume of applicants in today’s job market forces companies to rely on automated systems just to keep up.</p>
      
      <p>At the same time, job seekers are using AI tools such as ChatGPT to polish resumes and craft cover letters. Applicants are trying to stand out by leveraging these tools, but for many candidates, it can feel like they’re trying to survive in a game designed to work against them.</p>

      <p>Then came the next layer: Some companies have started using AI tools to detect AI-written resumes.</p>

      <p>Is it becoming acceptable for organizations to use AI for efficiency, but questionable when job seekers use it to compete with the same efficiency?</p><br><br>

      <h2>The Emotional Detachment Dilemma</h2>

      <p>One of the most concerning effects of AI-driven hiring is how easy it becomes for organizations to detach emotionally.</p>

      <p>Automated rejections, template emails, resumes filtered out without any actual human review. Layoffs being handled over short video calls or emails. Not every company does this, but enough have started that it’s becoming normalized.</p>

      <p>AI allows leadership to hide behind “process” to avoid the discomfort of human accountability for the impact of their decisions on human lives. And once empathy is removed from a system, it becomes easier to treat people as disposable.</p>

      <p>But the reality is that people are not data. People still need to survive, have bills to pay, families to support, and dignity to protect.</p>

      <p>With that in mind, it’s in the best interest of companies to want to sustain themselves as entities as well. And that brings up the question.</p>

      <p><em>When is it ok for an entity such as a corporation to want to use AI, and not ok for an entity such as a person?</em></p><br><br>

      <h2>Innovation Without Accountability</h2>

      <p>Many organizations celebrate innovation while quietly normalizing moral shortcuts, replacing human understanding with algorithms that decide who moves forward and who doesn’t.</p>

      <p>We built tools powerful enough to improve humanity, yet they’re often being used in ways that reduce it.</p>

      <p>We trained algorithms on historical patterns and then wondered why they reinforce bias. We optimized processes for speed and then wondered why empathy declined. We prioritized metrics over meaning and then wondered why people feel invisible.</p>

      <p>Perhaps it’s not that AI is replacing people, but our values are.</p>

      <p><em>Are our values being exposed, and AI is expediting our capabilities to use our bias?</em></p><br><br>

      <h2>Where Technology Should Fit In</h2>

      <p>As a person who works in IT myself, I understand automation, scripting, and efficiency. Perhaps it’s just my perspective, but I believe that technology is supposed to serve people, not the other way around.</p>

      <p><em>Is it reasonable to expect the entity of a corporation to adhere to the same rules of respect as we hold the entity of a human being?</em></p>

      <p>AI can absolutely streamline processes, surface qualified candidates faster, and reduce manual workload. I think these are the innovative intentions behind its use.</p>

      <p>The problem is when AI becomes a shield that organizations hide behind. When it’s used in ways that bypass empathy, avoid accountability, or distance decision-makers from the human beings behind each application.</p>

      <p><em>Should the job market be a psychological endurance test where human worth is measured only by an algorithm? Isn't it preferable that it be a reflection of skill, character, and potential characteristics that no machine can truly quantify?</em></p>

      <p>Ethics are somewhat subjective, aren’t they?</p>

      <p>What may be ethical and appropriate to one entity may not be to another. Whether that entity is a human being or a corporation.</p><br><br>

      <h2>The Real Issue Isn’t AI – It's Us</h2>

      <p>AI isn’t ruining the job market. People are forgetting that behind every resume is a human being trying to earn a living.</p>

      <p>If we keep using technology to avoid the discomfort of human accountability, then the real danger isn’t with using automation. It’s who we become when we let empathy disappear.</p>

      <p>Still, I remain hopeful. Because the truth is:</p>

      <p>We, as people, still have the ability to control how far AI goes, what we allow it to do, and how we choose to treat one another in the process.</p>

      <p><strong>By what measurement do each of us want to hold ourselves?</strong></p>
