      <h2>AI vs. Humanity: The Modern Job Market’s Ethical Collapse</h2>

      <p>As we approach the end of 2025 and move into 2026, I want to shed light on the impacts we’ve witnessed, seen, and felt across the job market with the emergence of AI in modern society.</p>

      <p>Now, I’ll start by saying that AI alone isn’t the single factor behind the job market we’re seeing in 2025. But I do believe the power of AI has significantly shaped what we’re experiencing and how it feels.</p>

      <p>Personally, I don’t think AI is the real problem. The problem lies in how AI is being used, and that issue is rooted more in human behavior than in the technology itself. AI is meant to be a resourceful tool, not a moral scapegoat.</p>

      <p>The bottom line is that people need to survive and make a living. But somewhere along the way, it seems that many organizations stopped seeing people as humans and started seeing them as data points.</p>

      <p>I believe AI in the job market was intended to make hiring fairer and more efficient. We have this advanced technology capable of reshaping how we live and work. Unfortunately, what we’re seeing instead is technology being used to make people disposable.</p>

      <p>Companies now use AI tools to automatically filter out applicants, scanning résumés for specific keywords before a real person ever lays eyes on them. Thousands of people are rejected in seconds, and no one feels responsible because “the system did it.”</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the job market is flooded with applicants desperate to stand out, using AI tools like ChatGPT to polish résumés and craft the perfect cover letters. It’s as if people are trying to survive in a game designed to work against them.</p>

      <p>Companies began using AI to filter out applicants. Applicants began using AI to stand out. Then companies started using AI to detect AI-written résumés.</p>

      <p>So, it’s acceptable for corporations to use AI for efficiency, but wrong for job seekers to use it to compete with that same efficiency? That hypocrisy truly speaks for itself.</p>

      <p>One of the most dangerous things about this shift is how easy it has become for companies to detach emotionally.</p>

      <p>Layoffs happen through email or video calls. Rejections are automated. People’s livelihoods are reduced to “applicant data.” The more efficient we make these systems, the less room there is for empathy.</p>

      <p>AI allows leadership to hide behind “process” to avoid the discomfort of human accountability. And once empathy is removed from a system, it becomes frighteningly easy to treat people as disposable.</p>

      <p>People still need to survive. They still have bills to pay, families to provide for, and personal dignity to protect. But in a world driven by metrics, efficiency, and automation, it seems that human needs no longer fit the equation.</p>

      <p>Many modern organizations celebrate innovation while quietly normalizing moral laziness, replacing human understanding with corporate algorithms that decide who matters and who doesn’t.</p>

      <p>It’s a disturbing evolution. We’ve built tools powerful enough to improve humanity, but we’re using them to erase it.</p>

      <p>I know many people will have different perspectives on this. But I don’t think AI is inherently evil. AI is a computer. It doesn’t have emotions, and it doesn’t devalue people. Humans programmed it to act that way.</p>

      <p>We built systems that measure productivity, not purpose. We trained algorithms to find patterns in old data, and then we wonder why they reinforce bias. We conditioned people to chase numbers instead of meaning, and now we’re surprised that empathy is disappearing.</p>

      <p><strong>AI isn’t replacing people. Our values are.</strong></p>

      <p>I work in IT. I understand automation, scripting, and efficiency. But I also understand something bigger: technology is supposed to serve people, not the other way around.</p>

      <p>When companies use AI to streamline processes, fine. But when they use it to avoid accountability or to stop seeing people as people, that’s where it crosses the line.</p>

      <p>The job market shouldn’t be a psychological endurance test where human worth is measured by an algorithm. It should be a reflection of skill, character, and potential — the things no machine can truly quantify.</p>

      <p>The bottom line is that AI isn’t ruining the job market. People are. By forgetting that behind every résumé is a person trying to make a living.</p>

      <p>If we keep using technology as a shield to avoid empathy, then the real danger isn’t automation. It’s what we’re becoming.</p>

      <p><strong>I remain hopeful, though, because I believe we still have the ability to decide what we don’t want AI to do — and how far it should impact us as human beings.</strong></p>
