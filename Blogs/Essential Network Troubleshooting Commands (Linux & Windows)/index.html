  <h1>Essential Network Troubleshooting Commands (Linux &amp; Windows):</h1>

  <p>
    After previously going over the <strong>10 Essential Linux Commands</strong>, let’s build on that with some 
    <strong>Essential Network Troubleshooting Commands</strong> for both <strong>Windows</strong> and <strong>Linux</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are various scenarios we may find ourselves in where any one of these commands can become beneficial very quickly. 
    One of the most common is troubleshooting and diagnosing connectivity issues. Other scenarios include resolving DNS issues, 
    addressing IP conflicts, or exploring how traffic flows through your network. The command line offers powerful tools to 
    dive deeper into what may be going on.
  </p>

  <p>
    This blog walks through several commonly used networking commands that help uncover useful information such as IP 
    configurations, DNS resolution, routing, active connections, network paths, and more. It’s based on material I put together 
    in my <strong>Cross-Platform Networking Commands</strong> tutorial, which is also available through my 
    <a href="https://mark-thompson01.github.io/MTPortfolio/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages portfolio</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal is to offer a practical reference — especially for those getting started in IT — by sharing real examples and tools 
    that are helpful in both personal labs and professional environments.
