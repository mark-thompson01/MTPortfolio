    <h3>Essentiail Network Commands</h3>
 

<section id="intro">

  <p style="font-style: italic;">The following outlines some <strong>Essential Network Commands</strong> used between <strong>Windows</strong>, <strong>Linux</strong>, as well as <strong>macOS</strong>.</p>
  <p>
    There are various scenarios we may find ourselves in where any one of these commands can become beneficial. 
    One of the most common is troubleshooting and diagnosing connectivity issues. Other scenarios include resolving DNS issues, 
    addressing IP conflicts, or exploring how traffic flows through your network. The command line offers powerful tools to 
    dive deeper into what may be going on.
  </p>

  <p>
    This blog walks through several commonly used networking commands that help uncover useful information such as IP 
    configurations, DNS resolution, routing, active connections, network paths, and more. It’s based on material I put together 
    in my <strong>Cross-Platform Networking Commands</strong> tutorial, which is available through my 
    <a href="https://mark-thompson01.github.io/MTPortfolio/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages portfolio</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal is to offer a practical reference — especially for those getting started in IT — by sharing real examples and tools 
    that are helpful in both personal labs and professional environments.
  </p><br><br><br><br>

 <h3><code>ping</code></h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Ping</strong> is the first responder on the network — it sends tiny data packets (ICMP echo requests) to a target IP or domain and waits for a reply, letting you verify that a device is reachable and measure how long the round-trip takes. It can be thought of as the digital equivalent of shouting "You there?" and listening for a reply.
  </p>

  <h3><code>ipconfig</code> / <code>ipconfig /all</code><br>     <code>ifconfig</code> / <code>ip a</code></h3>
  <p>
    These commands reveal a given system’s IP configuration on the network. Whether you're using <code>ipconfig</code> on Windows or <code>ifconfig</code> / <code>ip a</code> on Linux, they display your interface’s IP address, subnet, gateway, and more — essential for understanding how your machine is plugged into the network.
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <h4>Windows</h4>

  <h4>Linux</h4>
  <img src="Images/ifconfig.png" alt="ipconfig.png" style="width:650px; height:400px;"><br>
  <img src="Images/ipa.png" alt="ipa.png" style="width:650px; height:400px;"><br><br><br><br>

  
  <h3><code>arp -a</code></h3>
  <p>
    The <code>arp -a</code> command lets you peek behind the scenes of local communications by listing the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) table. It maps IP addresses to MAC addresses — like your system’s contact book for nearby devices.
  </p>
  <img src="Images/arp-a.PNG" alt="arp-a.PNG"><br><br><br><br>

  <h3><code>nslookup</code></h3>
  <p>
    <code>nslookup</code> is a Windows DNS investigation tool — it asks a DNS server for information about domain names and IP addresses. Whether you're hunting down where a website lives or diagnosing DNS failures, this command gives you a direct line to the domain name system.
  </p>

  <h3><code>host</code> / <code>dig</code></h3>
  <p>
    These Linux-based DNS tools go deeper than <code>nslookup</code>. <code>host</code> offers quick domain-to-IP lookups, while <code>dig</code> (Domain Information Groper) gives detailed query reports straight from DNS servers. They're like the X-ray scanners of DNS troubleshooting.
  </p>

  <img src="Images/dig1.png" alt="dig1.png" style="width:650px; height:400px;"><br><br><br><br>

  <h3><code>netstat -a</code> / <code>netstat -an</code></h3>
  <p>
    <code>netstat</code> exposes your system’s open doors — it shows which ports are listening, which connections are active, and which processes are using them. Use it to find suspicious activity, verify services, or see who your system is “talking” to.
  </p>

  <h3><code>tracert</code></h3>
  <p>
    Short for “trace route,” this Windows command traces the path packets take to reach a destination. It lists each network hop along the way, revealing delays, outages, or routing quirks that might be slowing things down.
  </p>
  <img src="Images/tracert.png" tracert.png"><br><br><br><br>

  <h3><code>pathping</code></h3>
  <p>
    <code>pathping</code> is a Windows command that is like <code>ping</code> and <code>tracert</code> merged into one — but with a twist. It sends pings to every hop along the path and calculates packet loss and latency at each point. It's the network path’s health report, not just its roadmap.
  </p>
  <img src="Images/pathping.png" alt="pathping.png"><br><br><br><br>

  <h3><code>traceroute</code></h3>
  <p>
    The Linux cousin to <code>tracert</code>, <code>traceroute</code> traces the journey of packets through the internet. Each hop is revealed along the route to your target, helping you visualize where things slow down, drop, or take detours in the digital world.
  </p>
  <img src="Images/traceroute.png" alt="traceroute.png" style="width:650px; height:400px;"><br><br><br><br>

  <h3><code>route print</code></h3>
  <h3><code>route -n</code> / <code>ip route</code></h3><br>
  <p>
    These commands unveil your system’s routing table — the rules it follows to decide where to send packets. <code>route print</code> on Windows and <code>route</code> on Linux give you a map of how traffic is directed across gateways and networks.
  </p>

  <p>Mastering these <strong>Essential Network Commands</strong> equips you with the tools to confidently troubleshoot, investigate, and understand what's happening on a system or network whether you're working with <strong>Windows</strong>, <strong>Linux</strong>, or <strong>macOS</strong>. From verifying connectivity with <code>ping</code>, to mapping routes with <code>tracert</code> or <code>traceroute</code>, to inspecting DNS responses to active connections, these commands are foundational for anyone in IT, cybersecurity, or system/network administration.</p>
<p>While these tools may seem basic, they’re often the first place professionals turn when diagnosing issues — and knowing how to interpret their output can set you apart as someone who truly understands how networks function.</p>
<p>As you continue building your technical skills, revisit these commands in different scenarios, experiment with their options, and incorporate them into your troubleshooting workflow. The command line doesn’t just tell you what’s wrong — it teaches you how systems behave under the hood.</p>
