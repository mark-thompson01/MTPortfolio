<h1>Windows Server Lab: Building an Active Directory Domain with Group Policies</h1>

    <p>This lab demonstrates basic Windows domain administration by setting up Windows Server 2016 on Oracle VirtualBox, and setting up Active Directory in a test environment along with Group Policies. Then further goes into using PowerShell to manage Active Directory and Group Policy on a Windows domain.</p>


  <h2>Active Directory</h2>
    <p><strong>Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft</strong> used to centrally manage and organize users, computers, and resources within a Windows-based network. Think of it as the control center of an IT environment — it handles identity verification, permissions, group policies, and secure access to resources like shared folders, printers, and applications.</p>
    

<li>
    <ul><strong>Authenticate users</strong> when they log in.</ul>
    <ul><strong>Assign permissions and enforce security policies</strong> across many computers at once.</ul>
    <ul><strong>Create and manage objects</strong> (like users, groups, and devices) in a structured and scalable way using a hierarchy called the <strong>domain</strong>.</ul>
</li>

<p>At the heart of AD is a <strong>Domain Controller</strong>, which acts like a trusted gatekeeper, validating credentials and enforcing rules.</p>
<p>Whether it's a small office or a large enterprise, Active Directory is critical for keeping systems organized, secure, and functioning efficiently — especially in environments where centralization and control are key.</p>
