<h1>Windows Server Lab: Building an Active Directory Domain with Group Policies</h1>

    <p>This lab demonstrates basic Windows domain administration by setting up Windows Server 2016 on Oracle VirtualBox, and setting up Active Directory in a test environment along with Group Policies. Then further goes into using PowerShell to manage Active Directory and Group Policy on a Windows domain.</p>


  <h2>Active Directory</h2>
    <p><strong>Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft</strong> used to centrally manage and organize users, computers, and resources within a Windows-based network. Think of it as the control center of an IT environment — it handles identity verification, permissions, group policies, and secure access to resources like shared folders, printers, and applications.</p>
    

<ul>
    <li><strong>Authenticate users</strong> when they log in.</li>
    <li><strong>Assign permissions and enforce security policies</strong> across many computers at once.</li>
    <li><strong>Create and manage objects</strong> (like users, groups, and devices) in a structured and scalable way using a hierarchy called the <strong>domain</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the heart of AD is a <strong>Domain Controller</strong>, which acts like a trusted gatekeeper, validating credentials and enforcing rules.</p>
<p>Whether it's a small office or a large enterprise, Active Directory is critical for keeping systems organized, secure, and functioning efficiently — especially in environments where centralization and control are key.</p>

  <h2>Group Policy</h2>
    <p><strong>Group Policy</strong> is a powerful feature in Windows Server that allows administrators to <strong>centrally manage and enforce</strong> settings across users and computers in an Active Directory environment.</p>
    <p>Through Group Policy, you can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enforce <strong>password complexity</strong> rules.</li>
        <li>Prevent access to <strong>Control Panel or Task Manager</strong></li>
        <li>Automatically <strong>map network drives</strong></li>
        <li>Configure <strong>desktop environments</strong></li>
        <li>Deploy <strong>software and scripts</strong> at startup or login</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Group Policies are created using the <strong>Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)</strong> and are linked to Active Directory objects like Organizational Units (OUs). When a user logs in or a computer boots up, these policies are applied to ensure <strong>consistent security and configuration settings</strong> across the organization.</p>

    <p>In a Windows Server lab, Group Policy lets you practice <strong>real-world system administration</strong> by designing and testing policies that shape the behavior of users and machines in a domain environment.

</p>

    

    <h2>Objects</h2>
    <p><strong>Active Directory objects</strong> are the <strong>building blocks</strong> of the Active Directory environment. Each object represents a real-world element — such as a user, computer, group, printer, or organizational unit — and contains information about that element in the form of <strong>attributes</strong>.</p>
    <p>These objects are stored in a <strong>hierarchical structure</strong> within the AD database, making it easier to organize, manage, and secure resources across a network.</p>

    <p>These objects are stored in a <strong>hierarchical structure</strong> within the AD database, making it easier to organize, manage, and secure resources across a network.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>User</strong> - Represents a person with login credentials and permissions.</li>
        <li><strong>Computer</strong> - Represents a workstation or server joined to the domain.</li>
        <li><strong>Group</strong> - A collection of users or computers for simplified permission management.</li>
        <li><strong>Organizational Unit (OU)</strong> - A container used to group and delegate control over objects.</li>
        <li><strong>Shared Resources</strong> - Includes objects like printers or file shares that can be managed centrally.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Each object is uniquely identified by a <strong>Distinguished Name (DN)</strong> and can have specific <strong>Group Policies</strong> applied to it.</p>
    <p>In essence, AD objects give administrators the power to manage <strong>identity, access, and organization</strong> in a consistent, scalable, and secure way — all from a centralized point of control.</p>
