  <h1>Linux: An Introduction</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>What is Linux?</h2>
    <p>Linux is a family of open-source operating systems based on the Linux kernel. It provides a Unix-like environment and powers a wide range of devices, from personal computers and servers to smartphones, routers, smart TVs, and even spacecraft. Unlike proprietary systems, Linux is collaborative, customizable, and freely distributed under licenses such as the GNU General Public License (GPL).</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>A Brief History of Linux</h2>
    <p>The history of Linux begins in 1991 when Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer science student, announced a personal project to create a free operating system kernel. Inspired by Unix and driven by a desire to learn, Torvalds released version 0.01 of the Linux kernel. As word spread, developers around the world joined the effort. Combined with components from the GNU Project (launched by Richard Stallman in 1983), Linux evolved into a full-fledged operating system.</p>
    <p>Over time, Linux matured into a powerful and secure platform. Today, it's the backbone of the internet, the foundation of Android smartphones, and the core of countless embedded systems and supercomputers.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>How Linux is Everywhere</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Smartphones</strong>: Android, the most widely used mobile OS, is based on the Linux kernel.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Web Servers</strong>: The majority of the world's websites are hosted on Linux servers.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Cloud Infrastructure</strong>: Major providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure rely on Linux-based systems.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Supercomputers</strong>: All of the top 500 fastest supercomputers in the world run on Linux.</li><br>
      <li><strong>IoT Devices</strong>: Routers, smart TVs, automotive systems, and home automation tools often run stripped-down Linux variants.</li><br>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Linux Kernel: The Heart of the System</h2>
    <p>Many people think of Linux as an operating system, but technically, Linux refers to the <strong>kernel</strong> — the core component that interacts directly with hardware. A kernel handles crucial low-level tasks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Process management</strong></li><br>
      <li><strong>Memory management</strong></li><br>
      <li><strong>Device communication</strong></li><br>
      <li><strong>System calls and security enforcement</strong></li><br>
    </ul>
    <p>What users typically interact with — the graphical interface, command-line tools, and software — are part of a <strong>Linux distribution</strong>, which includes the kernel and a suite of other essential software.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What is a Linux Distribution?</h2>
    <p>A <strong>Linux distribution</strong> (or distro) is a complete operating system built around the Linux kernel. Distributions package the kernel with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>System libraries and utilities</li><br>
      <li>Software management tools</li><br>
      <li>Desktop environments or server components</li><br>
      <li>Security updates and user interfaces</li><br>
    </ul>
    <p>Some popular Linux distributions include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ubuntu</strong>: User-friendly and widely adopted in desktops and servers</li><br>
      <li><strong>Debian</strong>: Stable, community-focused foundation for many other distros</li><br>
      <li><strong>Fedora</strong>: Cutting-edge features and technologies</li><br>
      <li><strong>Arch Linux</strong>: Minimalist and highly customizable</li><br>
      <li><strong>Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)</strong>: Enterprise-grade with long-term support</li><br>
    </ul>
    <p>Each distribution serves a different purpose, from casual use and learning to enterprise deployments and specialized systems.</p>

    <h2>Important Components of a Linux System</h2>
    <p>To fully understand how Linux works, it's helpful to know its major components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Kernel</strong>: The core that communicates with hardware.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Shell</strong>: The command-line interpreter that lets users interact with the system.</li><br>
      <li><strong>File System</strong>: Linux uses a hierarchical structure starting from the root directory (<code>/</code>).</li><br>
      <li><strong>System Libraries</strong>: Essential shared code used by applications and services.</li><br>
      <li><strong>System Daemons</strong>: Background processes that handle tasks like networking, printing, and scheduling.</li><br>
      <li><strong>User Interface</strong>: May include desktop environments like GNOME, KDE, or lightweight interfaces like XFCE.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Package Manager</strong>: Tools like <code>apt</code>, <code>yum</code>, or <code>dnf</code> manage software installation and updates.</li><br>
    </ul>

    <p>This introduction serves as the starting point for further exploration. Whether you're curious about system administration, programming, or cybersecurity, Linux offers the flexibility, transparency, and control to help you grow and innovate.</p>
