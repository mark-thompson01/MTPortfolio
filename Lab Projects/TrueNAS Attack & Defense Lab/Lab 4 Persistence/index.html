  <h1>NAS Security Attack & Defense Lab 4</h1>
  <h2>Persistence | Detetction & Response</h2>
  <p>We’ve made it this far to lab 4! On the offensive side, a successful brute force attack has allowed access to be gained on the target NAS server, followed by a successful privilege escalation attack to gain root access to the compromised system. Now it’s time to establish persistence on the target NAS server.</p>
  <h3>Offensive</h3>
  <p>To establish persistence in this scenario I’m going to add a public SSH key to the <code>user’s ~/ .ssh/authorized_keys</code> file to be able to easily re-authenticate to the system.</p>
  <p>To set that up I’m going to generate an SSH key pair on the Kali Linux machine, like so.</p>
  <img src="Images/sshkeygen.png" alt="sshkeygen">
  <p>Then copy the public key to the target system</p>
  <img src="Images/keypairtransfer.png" alt="keypairtransfer">
  <p>IN the <code>/tmp</code> directory on the target NAS system, verify that the <code>id_rsa.pub</code> public key file is there.</code></p>
  <img src="Images/lslisting.png" alt="lslisting">
  <p>I'll then the file from the <code>/tmp</code> to <code>/root</code> directory on the system.</p>
  <img src="Images/movefromtmptoroot.png" alt="movefromtmptoroot">
  <p>From there, I'll run the following commands to setup an <code>~/.ssh</code> directory for this keypair, as well as use the <code>echo</code> command rename the <code>id_rsa.pub</code> file to <code>authorized_keys</code>, then assign permissions to the <code>authorized_keys</code> file and <code>~/.ssh</code> directory.</p>
  <img src="Images/sshkeygensetup3.png" alt="sshkeygensetup3">

  <p>Then from there, it’s time to test the persistence.</p>
  <p>And we are back in.</p>
  <img src="Images/persistence0.png" alt=persistence0">
  <p>In this scenario, you would still have to go through the steps of setting the TERM environment variable and exploiting the SUID bit in <code>vim</code> to escalate privileges. However, in establishing persistence, this would give you a way back into the system after a reboot.</p>


  <h3>Defensive</h3>
  <p><strong>Step 1 - Detection of SSH Key-Based Persistence</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Audit:</strong> <code>authorized_keys</code> file.</p>
    <p>SSH key-based persistence relies on the presence of unauthorized public keys in <code>authorized_keys</code> file. Check for unusual entries.</p>
  
  <img src="Images/detection1png" alt=detection1png">
  <p>Well, here we have a concatenated public key file with an @kali, that right there would indeed be very suspicious and considered an IoC to immediately respond to and investigate.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 2 - Check SSH Logs:</strong></p>
 
  <p>This would be another case to go through the <code>auth.log</code> as done in the previous lab examples.</p>
  <img src="Images/authlog0.png" alt="authlog0">
  <img src="Images/AcceptedAuth.png" alt="AcceptedAuth">

  <p><strong>Step 3 - Check Recent File Modification</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Identify Recent File Modifications</strong></p>
  <p>Identify recently modified <code>.ssh/authorized_keys files</code></p>
  <p>Here we have an example of using the <code>find</code> command to identify recently modified <code>authorized _keys</code> files. This command searches for any <code>authorized_keys</code> files modified within the last 7 days, a common indicator of unauthorized persistence.</p>
  <img src="Images/recentfilemod.png" alt="recentfilemod">

  <p><strong>Process Monitoring</strong></p>
  <p>Use the <code>who</code> command to identify active SSH sessions.</p>
  <p>Here we see the user account ronny making a connection from the Kali Linux IP address.</p>
  <img src="Images/who" alt="who">
  <img src="Images/terminate0.png" alt=terminate0">

  <p><strong>Immediate Response</strong></p>
  <p>Upon detecting these active malicious/suspicious connections, I would immediately terminate them.</p>
  <p>I would start using the <code>kill</code> command with the <code>-9</code> to forcefully terminate any PID associated with the ronny user account.</p>
  <img src="Images/kill.png" alt="kill">

  <p><strong>Mitigation of SSH Key-Based Persistence</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Step 1 - Remove Unauthorized Keys</strong></p>

  <p>Manually inspect and remove unauthorized entries from <code>authorized_keys:</code></p>
  <img src="Images/removeauthkeys.png" alt="removeauthkeys">
  <img src="Images/removeentryfromfile.png" alt="removeentryfromfile">
  <img src="Images/modified.png" alt="modified">

  <p><strong>Step 2 - Change User Passwords</strong></p>
  <p>In case an attacker also knows the user’s password, reset it to prevent further access.</p>
  <img src="Images/passwordreset.png" alt="passwordreset">

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The overall detection of this activity would indeed call for immediate response in the event of discovering an active IoC with a suspicious IP, process, and/or unusual activity from a standard user account on the server.</p>
  <p>In this case and scenario, there are further mitigation options that are applicable in different circumstances depending on how the server is being used and the needs of the given environment.</p>
  <p>In lab 2, password-based authentication for SSH was disabled to mitigate from SSH brute force attacks. Which is typically a recommended practice to configure SSH and utilize public-key based authentication.</p>
  <p>Even with that in place, on the offensive side if we manage to find another way into the system, this method of persistence could still be set up.</p>
  <p>In such cases, depending on the use of the server and needs of the environment, there are a few different directions for mitigation that would be applicable in different scenarios.</p>
  <p>If SSH isn’t really needed – the service could simply be disabled along with SSH key usage disabled to go the extra mile. However, SSH can always be re-enabled and setup if the server is compromised through a different method.</p>
  <p>If the operating system is granular enough to setup 2FA for SSH on accounts or explicit permissions for user accounts to use SSH, that’s another avenue. </p>
  <p>If SSH is needed, an IDS/IPS or other type of monitoring tool specifically set up to alert on <code>authorized_keys</code> would be my next consideration in my aim to mitigate against this.</p>
