    <h1>NAS Security Attack & Defense Lab</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the <strong>NAS Security Attack & Defense Lab</strong> demonstration. This project is designed to showcase hands-on scenarios involving both offensive and defensive cybersecurity techniques. Through four structured lab exercises, I present simulated attacks and corresponding mitigation strategies to provide a comprehensive understanding of different threats and how to counteract them effectively.</p>
​
    <p>This lab serves as an opportunity to demonstrate my ability to think critically, analyze security risks, and implement practical solutions. It reflects my passion for exploring both red and blue team activities, emphasizing the importance of understanding the mindset of attackers while building strong defenses.</p>
​
    <h2>Overview of the Labs:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lab 1: SSH Brute Force Attack</strong><br>Explore how attackers perform brute force attacks to compromise SSH services. Learn to detect the attack in progress and implement defensive measures to harden the system against future attempts.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Lab 2: Successful Brute Force Login</strong><br>Observe what happens when a brute force attack succeeds in accessing a system. Follow steps to detect unauthorized logins, respond effectively, and mitigate vulnerabilities to prevent reoccurrence.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Lab 3: Privilege Escalation</strong><br>Investigate how attackers escalate privileges after gaining initial access. Discover techniques to identify privilege escalation activities and implement safeguards to secure elevated accounts.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Lab 4: Persistence</strong><br>Understand how attackers establish persistence on a compromised system. Learn how to detect backdoors, remove malicious persistence mechanisms, and prevent them from being reintroduced.</li>
    </ul>
​
​
​
    <h2>Lab Objectives:</h2>
     <ul>
        <li><strong>Hands-on Demonstrations:</strong> Each lab goes through different attack scenarios and provides step-by-step defenses, making complex concepts accessible and engaging.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Educational Insights:</strong> Clear explanations of attack methods and mitigation techniques pertaining to each scenario.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Presentation of Findings:</strong> Writing a professional penetration tester or cybersecurity analyst report to finalize the presentation after showcasing each lab</li>
    </ul><br>

    <p>The following are the detailed Attack & Defense Labs 1 through 4, along with the analysis and reporting documentation</p>
