    <h1>NAS Security Attack & Defense Lab</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the <strong>NAS Security Attack & Defense Lab</strong> demonstration. This project is designed to showcase hands-on scenarios involving both offensive and defensive cybersecurity techniques. Through four structured lab exercises, I present simulated attacks and corresponding mitigation strategies to provide a comprehensive understanding of different threats and how to counteract them effectively.</p>
​
    <p>This lab serves as an opportunity to demonstrate my ability to think critically, analyze security risks, and implement practical solutions. It reflects my passion for exploring both red and blue team activities, emphasizing the importance of understanding the mindset of attackers while building strong defenses.</p>
​
    <h2>Overview of the Labs:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lab 1: SSH Brute Force Attack</strong><br>Demonstrates a method of how attackers perform brute force attacks in attempt to compromise SSH services. Followed by steps to detect the attack in progress and implement defensive measures to harden the system against future attempts.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Lab 2: Successful Brute Force Login</strong><br>Outlines what happens when a brute force attack succeeds in accessing a system. Followed by steps to detect unauthorized logins, respond effectively, and mitigate vulnerabilities to prevent reoccurrence.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Lab 3: Privilege Escalation</strong><br>A purposely set misconfiguration is exploited in an executable program binary to carry out a successful privilege escalation. Followed by steps to detect and mitigate.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Lab 4: Persistence</strong><br>One of several persistence techniques is demonstrated to maintain ease of access to the system. Followed by steps to detect and mitigate.</li>
    </ul>
​
​
​
    <h2>Lab Objectives:</h2>
     <ul>
        <li><strong>Hands-on Demonstrations:</strong> Each lab goes through different attack scenarios and provides step-by-step defenses.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Educational Insights:</strong> Clear explanations of attack methods and mitigation techniques pertaining to each scenario.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Presentation of Findings:</strong> Writing a professional penetration tester or cybersecurity analyst report to finalize the presentation after showcasing each lab.</li>
    </ul><br>

    <p>The following are the detailed Attack & Defense Labs 1 through 4, along with the analysis and reporting documentation.</p>
