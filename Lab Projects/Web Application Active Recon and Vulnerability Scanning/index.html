<h1>Web Application Active Recon and Vulnerability Scanning</h1>
<h2>Building in Progress</h2>
<p>In today’s interconnected world, web applications are at the core of modern communication, commerce, and collaboration. However, they also represent one of the most common attack surfaces for malicious actors.  </p>

<p>This Web Application Active Recon and Vulnerability Scanning lab explores the fundamental methodologies used by cybersecurity professionals to assess, analyze, and secure web application infrastructure.
</p>

<p>Through this project, I aim to showcase my understanding of reconnaissance techniques, vulnerability scanning tools, and analysis processes. The lab uses a custom-built web application hosted on a Raspberry Pi running Apache, rebranded into a file portal web page purposely configured with Webdav for uploading files to. This application is designed to simulate real-world vulnerabilities, making it an excellent learning tool for web application security.
</p>

<h2>Purpose of the lab</h2>
<p>This lab is both a personal learning endeavor and a demonstration of the following</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Technical Proficiency:</strong>Building a web application, configuring a server, and deploying intentional misconfigurations for educational purposes.</li><br>

	<li><strong>Security Mindset:</strong>Applying industry-standard tools and techniques to perform active reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning in a controlled environment.</li><br>

	<li><strong>Professional Documentation:</strong>Documenting each step with clarity and precision, mirroring what a professional penetration tester or security analyst would deliver in a real-world report.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Web App Configuration:</strong></li><br>
		<ul><li>Create a customized fictional index.html web page on an installation of Apache 2.4.59 running on a Raspberry Pi 3.</ul></li><br>

		<ul><li>Purposely configure the installation to be vulnerable with specific misconfigurations.</ul></li><br>

	<li><strong>Active Reconnaissance:</strong></li><br>
		<ul><li>Enumerate HTTP and service information on port 80 with the use of nmap scripts and WhatWeb. Perform some directory busting with the use of dirb, dirbuster, and gobuster.</ul></li><br>

	<li><strong>Vulnerability Scanning:</strong></li><br>
		<ul><li>Use tools such as <code>nmap</code>, <code>nikto</code>, and <strong>Burp Suite</strong> to identify web server misconfigurations, outdated software, and exploitable vulnerabilities.</ul></li><br>

	<li><strong>Analysis and Reporting:</strong></li><br>
		<ul><li>Deliver a clear and actionable summary of findings, demonstrating both technical skill and communication ability.</ul></li>
</ol>


<h3>Toolset</h3>

<p>This lab incorporates a diverse array of tools to demonstrate my capability with industry-standard solutions:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Active Recon:</strong> <code>nmap</code>, <code>whatweb</code>, <code>dirb</code>, <code>dirbuster</code>, <code>gobuster</code></li><br>
	<li><strong>Vulnerability Scanning:</strong> <code>nmap</code>, <code>nikto</code>, and <strong>Burp Suite.</strong><br></li><br>
	<li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Report generation that adheres to professional documenation standards.</li>

<h2>Configuring the Web Application</h2>
<p>For this lab demonstration I am purposely making this customized application vulnerable with impactful misconfigurations or setups to make the web application more interesting for tools like Nmap, Nikto, or Burp Suite to discover. </p>
<p>WebDAV has been set up on the web application for this demonstration.</p>

<h3>Specific Misconfigurations for this lab</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Setting weak authentication for WebDAV</li>
	<li>Directory listings enabled</li>
	<li>Hidden directories and files</li>
	<li>Exposed sensitive configuration</li>
	<li>Crafted XSS vulnerability</li>
</ol> 


<h3>Weak Authentication for WebDAV</h3>
<p>To get started, let's make sure WebDAV is enabled with <strong>Basic Authentication</strong> and a weak username/password.</p>
<strong>webdav.conf</strong>

#Image2

<h3>Directory Listings Enabled</h3>
<p>The “directory listing” behavior in Apache is controlled by the Options directive in the Apache configuration files. Specifically, the indexes option enables directory listing. If Indexes is included in the Options directive for a directory, Apache will display a list of files within that directory when no default file (e.g., index.html, index.php) is present.</p>

<p>Snippet of code in the <strong>/etc/apache2/apache2.conf</strong> file showing Indexes included Options directive.</p>

<p>This is also set for WebDAV in the <strong>webdav.conf</strong> file.</p>

<h3>Hidden Directories and Files</h3>
<p>For the purpose of this lab, I have created some hidden and not so hidden directories and files to have something to detect for demonstration purposes. These are directories and files that are stored in the /var/ww/html of the Apache setup, making it easy to manually navigate to in a browser with directory listings enabled on the web server, along for the directory busting tools to easily detect them as well as Burp Suite.</p>

<h3>Exposed Sensitive Configuration</h3>
<p>Insecurely exposed configuration files, like <code>config.php</code> file in this example, pose a significant security risk to web applications. Such files often contain sensitive data, including data credentials, API keys, or server configurations.</p>
<p>When left publicly accessible, such as in this example, attackers can easily retrieve these files and leverage the information go gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or compromise the underlying infrastructure.</p>
<p>This vulnerability highlights the importance of securing sensitive files and following best practices for web server configuration to minimize attack surfaces.</p>

<h3>Crafted XSS Vulnerability</h3>


<h2>Active Recon</h2>
<p><strong>Nmap:</strong>In the previous lab I did for Web Server Enumeration and Exploitation, I used a handful of nmap commands and other commands to extract web application components.</p>
<p>In this example, I’m going to take all of the commands that I would like to start out with and create a bash script to automate the process and run them altogether.</p>
# Add image of nmap script bash script being created and ran. Explain it all alway. 
# Then demonstrate WhatWeb, then directory busting.
