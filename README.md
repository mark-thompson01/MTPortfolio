# MTPortfolio — Labs, Blogs, and the Journey

A live portfolio site of hands-on projects I've worked on and tinkered around with across **Networking, System Administration, Scripting & Automation, as well as Network Security**.  

This repo powers my GitHub Pages portfolio site and contains both polished pages **and** the inevitable “in-progress” bits that come with real learning.

**Live site:** https://mark-thompson01.github.io/MTPortfolio/  

This project first started out in June of 2024. At the time, I was growing in my
current role as an IT Support Specialist and exploring cybersecurity after earning
the CompTIA Security+ certification. The portfolio started out as a display of the hands-on network security projects I was tinkering around with at the time.

As I further explored the landscape of IT, I realized two things. That the display of hands-on projects in today's job market is one of the best ways to standout. In addition to that, I realized my aspirations lie in becoming as diverse as possible across platforms, and developing the skillset of a system administrator. 

From there, I focused on designing hands-on labs and constructing web pages 
with detailed screen shots of diverse hands-on projects across platforms. From here, my goal is add more labs overtime and to grab a keyboard and skill up.

## Why this repo looks “real”
This portfolio was built incrementally. You’ll find:
- **Misspelled/legacy folders** that remain for working links.
- **Unused CSS / experiments** I kept so I can revisit or compare.
- **Hidden or not-yet-linked pages** that are prototypes for future labs.

Rather than rewrite history (and break URLs), I’m documenting the path I took and continuing from here.

-- Windows Event Viewer, DHCP renews, cache flushes;
-- Identifying network paths, active connections, and reading routing tables.
-- Troubleshooting connectivity, DNS, IP Configuration, duplicate MAC addresses, etc.
-- Web page edits
-- General lab tinkering troubleshooting run into's

- **Hands-on Application:**
-- Hands on application with network security; nmap, Advanced IP Scanner, Kali Linux toolbox, etc.
-- Applying different network commands to troubleshoot a variety of network issues across platforms.
-- Cisco Catalyst switch configuration (Hands-on Cisco CCNA studies)
-- Windows Domain build, Active Directory, Group Policy, DNS, and DHCP Setup and Implementation;
---- (Configuration, Management, and Administration)
-- PowerShell fundamentals and basic PowerShell scripting
-- Linux fundamentals and basic Bash shell scripting
-- Using PowerShell and Bash to automate tasks

## Roadmap (ongoing)
- Add more **labs** over the course of time. 
- Do deeper dives in PowerShell and Bash shell scripting and automation.
- Move onto basic Python scripting.
- Build labs based on Cisco CCNA studies.
- Grab a keyboard and continuously develop hands-on skills across various tools and plaforms. 
- Prepare myself for the role of an IT System Administrator.
