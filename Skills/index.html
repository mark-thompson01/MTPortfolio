  <h1>Computer Networking</h1>
  <p>Under constructuion
  </p>

  <p>Computer Networking is the physics of computing—the invisible force that brings machines to life through conversation. It’s a system of signals, protocols, and digital handshakes that allows computers, servers, and devices to exchange information, collaborate, and respond in real time.</p>

  <p>At its core, computer networking is how computers talk. Whether two machines are across the room or across the world, networking creates the pathways that allow them to share data, access resources, and solve problems together—almost like a digital nervous system.</p>

  <p>Imagine each computer as a brilliant mind with its own capabilities. Without networking, those minds are isolated. Networking connects them, building highways for ideas to travel, messages to be delivered, and systems to work in sync.</p>

  <p>From the smallest home Wi-Fi setup to the vast infrastructure of the internet, computer networking is the silent engine of the digital age, powering video calls, cloud computing, data transfers, cybersecurity, and so much more. It is the choreography behind modern life, the rhythm that keeps everything in motion.</p>

  <p>It’s the pulse of technology. The translator of binary. The voice of machines.</p>
